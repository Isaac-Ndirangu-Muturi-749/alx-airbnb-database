### Steps Taken
1. Used `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to monitor query performance.
2. Added indexes and partitioned large tables.
3. Refactored queries for better execution plans.

### Results
Query execution times reduced significantly. Further suggestions include implementing materialized views for complex aggregations.
